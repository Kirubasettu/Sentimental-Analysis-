# Sentimental-Analysis-
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that involves determining and extracting subjective information from text data. The goal is to identify and analyze the sentiments, opinions, emotions, or attitudes expressed in a piece of text, such as a review, social media post, or news article. Sentiment analysis algorithms classify the text as positive, negative, or neutral, providing insights into the overall sentiment of the content. This technique is widely used in various applications, including customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, market research, and understanding public opinion.
